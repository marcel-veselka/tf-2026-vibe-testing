# Optional · API testing with an agent

**20–30 minutes.** At home, or at the workshop if there is time left.

Foodora has an API. You never see it in the Zoo, because the UI hides it — but the UI's own
traffic tells you where it is.

## The task

> Find Foodora's API. Get your agent to write tests for it. Then use it to prove one thing the UI
> gets wrong.

## Setup

Nothing new: the root `npm install` covers it. Keep the repository root open in VS Code, and run
tests from this folder:

```bash
cd experiments/2_API
```

You do not need to copy an API key. [`fixtures.ts`](./fixtures.ts) opens the app once and reads
the key the app itself sends — it is public, every visitor's browser has it. Your tests get a
ready-to-use `foodoraApi` request context.

## Steps

1. **Find the API yourself.** Open [foodora.lovable.app](https://foodora.lovable.app/), then
   DevTools → **Network** → **Fetch/XHR**, and reload. Open one request: look at the URL, the
   `apikey` header and the JSON that comes back. Then open a restaurant and watch the second call.

   Three things trip people up. The API is **not** on `foodora.lovable.app` — look at the host.
   Rows are picked with filters, `?slug=eq.1`, not paths like `/restaurants/1`. And every request
   needs the key: in a browser tab, add `&apikey=<the key>` to the URL.

   <summary>Stuck? A working request to open in your browser</summary>

   Every restaurant, sorted by name:

   ```
   https://uqcjwtfrmayvjhkzgiou.supabase.co/rest/v1/restaurants?select=name,slug,delivery_fee,promo&order=name.asc&apikey=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InVxY2p3dGZybWF5dmpoa3pnaW91Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NzYwMjMxMjksImV4cCI6MjA5MTU5OTEyOX0.8rplar0Db8NwpEPPGxn98xkMPipH_MNuzIh7nDhTowA
   ```

   One restaurant: replace `select=name,slug,delivery_fee,promo&order=name.asc` with `slug=eq.2`
   (Pizza Corner). The key is the app's public one — every visitor's browser sends it.

   </details>
2. **Ask your agent for tests**, in one prompt:

   ```
   Write Playwright API tests in experiments/2_API/tests/restaurants.spec.ts. Import test and
   expect from ../fixtures (that is experiments/2_API/fixtures.ts) and use its foodoraApi fixture. The API contract is
   https://foodora.lovable.app/openapi.json. Check the restaurant list and one restaurant's menu
   against it. Take expected results from spec/foodora-spec.md, not from what the API returns.
   ```

   The contract is the API's own [OpenAPI schema](https://foodora.lovable.app/openapi.json) — served
   by the app, describing the API on the other host: every column of `restaurants` and
   `menu_items`, with its type and whether it can be empty.

3. Run them from this folder: `npx playwright test tests/`
4. **Use the API as a second source of truth.** It knows each restaurant's delivery fee. Ask your
   agent, in the same chat:

   ```
   Add a test in experiments/2_API/tests/ that opens Burger Palace in the browser, quick-adds one
   Classic Beef Burger, opens the cart, and asserts the Delivery Fee shown there equals that
   restaurant's delivery_fee from the API. The rule is FD-05 in spec/foodora-spec.md.
   ```

   Whatever the result, check the spec before you change the test.

## Done when

Your tests run, and one of them proves an `FD-05` bug from the API side.

## Bonus

- What does the API return for a restaurant that does not exist? For a column that does not
  exist? Without the key? Which of those deserve a test — and which would your agent have written
  without being asked?
- Look at `delivery_fee` in [the schema](https://foodora.lovable.app/openapi.json). What type
  would you expect? What does the contract say? Does that change how your UI test compares them?
- Ask your agent for a contract test: every row the API returns must match the schema. Would it
  still pass if someone added a column tomorrow — and should it?
- Ask your agent to test *placing an order* through the API. What does it find? The schema
  documents only two tables — what does your agent do about everything else?

## If you get stuck

1. **Ask your neighbour.** Or your team, after lunch.
2. **Check [troubleshooting](../../docs/setup-troubleshooting.md#on-the-workshop-day)** — the workshop-day table.
3. **Shortcut:** [`solutions/restaurants.spec.ts`](./solutions/restaurants.spec.ts) — five
   read-only tests, the last one catching the fee bug. Run it from this folder with `npx playwright test solutions/`.
