# Speed Gap Battle — private pack

Everything here stays out of the attendee repo until 15:15 on 24 September. The repo is (or will
be) public; these files give the Battle away.

| File | What it is | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`lovable-prompts.md`](lovable-prompts.md) | Remix Foodora, then three prompts — one per feature, each with a planted bug | Build before Thursday |
| [`answer-key.md`](answer-key.md) | The three planted bugs, how to reproduce each, and how to score Accuracy | Keep private; read at the debrief |
| [`spec/battle/`](../../spec/battle/) | FD-09 … FD-11, written like the main spec | Merged at 15:13 from this branch |

## Timeline

1. **Today / tomorrow:** remix Foodora as `foodora-new`, paste the three prompts. Do **not** publish.
   Ask Claude to verify the build in Lovable's preview.
2. **Thursday lunch (12:00–13:00):** publish `foodora-new` to `foodora-new.lovable.app`.
3. **15:13:** push `battle/reveal` and merge its first commit (the stories).
4. **15:15:** reveal slide "3 new features, one new build". Teams `git pull` and run their suite
   with `FOODORA_URL=https://foodora-new.lovable.app`.
5. **16:00 debrief:** open `answer-key.md`. Which suites caught which planted bug?

The original `foodora.lovable.app` never changes, so the morning exhibits keep working.
