<!--
09:17 — the statement just said it; this is what it looks like. Source out loud: Anthropic's AI-native SDLC playbook,
21 August 2026 — "Code is no longer the bottleneck. The human-speed steps around it are." Six stages, each commits an artifact the next one reads.
Stage 4 is the callback for later: the agent proves its own fix with a test it wrote. Who checks that test?
[click] Ask the room first and let two people answer. Do not rush to yours.
[click] Mine: shape it, maintain it, define the rules, manage the whole process.
Then be honest: whether that is a job title or a skill every engineer needs — nobody knows yet. We are all
working it out, and today is one day of that.

# Intent-driven testing: <span class="y">say what, not how</span>

The test states the user's goal and what must be true afterwards. The agent works out the clicks.

<div class="cards c3 intent">
<div class="card"><div class="n">THE AGENT RUNS EVERY TIME</div><h3>It plays the test</h3><p>Reads the intent on every run and finds its own way. Survives a redesign — costs an LLM call, and can vary.</p><p class="who">Wopee.io · Momentic · Midscene</p></div>
<div class="card"><div class="n">THE AGENT WRITES THE CODE</div><h3>Intent in, Playwright out</h3><p>A plan in Markdown, reviewed, turned into a test that runs without an LLM.</p><p class="who">Playwright Test Agents · QA Wolf · Octomind</p></div>
<div class="card dark"><div class="n">THE CATCH</div><h3>Who decides what is correct?</h3><p>Best agent found real web app bugs at <b>26% F1</b>. Given a human checklist: <b>49%</b>.</p><p class="who">WebTestBench, March 2026</p></div>
</div>

<div class="banner">The intent says <em>what to do</em>. Your spec says <em>what is right</em>.</div>

<style>
.intent .who { font-size: 0.72em; margin-top: 0.8em; opacity: 0.7; }
</style>

<!--
09:21 — 3 minutes. If the developer only says what they want, the test has to do the same: this is what that looks like.
Vendor term, no standard definition (Harness, mabl, Momentic, BlazeMeter). Two camps: agent on every run (Wopee.io,
Exhibit 4) vs agent writes code once (Playwright planner/generator, Exhibit 2). Hybrids cache and replay (Stagehand, Momentic).
The number: WebTestBench (Kong et al., arXiv 2603.25226, 26 Mar 2026) — best F1 26.4% (GPT-5.1), precision ~30%;
with a gold checklist 49.2% (Claude Sonnet 4.5). Deciding what to check is the hard part, not clicking.
Risk to name: an agent that adapts can adapt past your bug — Playwright's healer may skip a test "if it believes functionality is broken".
That is why AGENTS.md says: expected results come from spec/. Full report: docs/research/intent-driven-testing.md.

# The new stack in <span class="y">4 pieces</span>

<StackDiagram />

<!--
09:24 — builds in four clicks, one sentence each. The Zoo makes every piece concrete.
[click] SKILL.md — know-how the agent loads only when a task needs it. Exhibit 3 and the afternoon.
[click] CLI — the agent drives the browser with shell commands; answers are file paths. Exhibit 3.
[click] MCP — the same browser, through tools that live in the agent's context. Exhibit 2.
[click] The testing agent — Wopee.io maps the app on its own, or your agent calls it as an MCP tool. Exhibit 4.

# Two ways to give an agent <span class="y">hands</span>

Both let an AI agent use a tool — a browser, GitHub, a database. They package it very differently.

<div class="cards c2 hands">
<div class="card"><div class="n">MCP · MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL</div><h3>A standard socket for tools</h3>
<p>The AI app plugs into a <b>server</b>. The server lists its <b>tools</b> — the agent sees every one before it starts.</p>
<ul><li>~34,000 servers in the official registry</li><li>~0.5 billion SDK downloads a month</li><li>In Copilot, VS Code, Claude, OpenAI, Gemini</li></ul></div>
<div class="card"><div class="n">CLI · COMMAND LINE</div><h3>The terminal the agent already knows</h3>
<p>The agent types commands — <code>git</code>, <code>gh</code>, <code>npx playwright cli</code> — and reads <code>--help</code> only when it needs to.</p>
<ul><li>Big results go to files, not into the chat</li><li>A skill costs ~100 tokens until it is used</li><li>Needs a shell — and a sandbox around it</li></ul></div>
</div>

<!--
09:26 — plain words first. MCP: one standard way to plug tools into any AI app (the "USB-C" of AI tools). CLI: the agent just uses the terminal like we do.
Sources: registry.modelcontextprotocol.io API, 33,919 servers on 21 Sep 2026; MCP blog 28 Jul 2026 ("close to half a billion" SDK downloads/month);
MCP is run by the Agentic AI Foundation (Linux Foundation) since 9 Dec 2025, co-founded by Anthropic, OpenAI, Block.
Skills: ~100 tokens of metadata per skill until invoked (agentskills.io spec). Anthropic sandboxing post, Oct 2025: a shell needs filesystem + network isolation.

# What the data says: <span class="y">design beats protocol</span>

Head-to-head studies, 2025–2026 — same tasks, one done through MCP, one through a CLI.

<div class="cards c4 stats">
<div class="card"><div class="stat">~26K</div><h3>tokens before you type</h3><p>GitHub's MCP server: 35 tool definitions, loaded upfront.</p></div>
<div class="card"><div class="stat">Tie</div><h3>on success rate</h3><p>100% vs 100% (120 runs). 86% vs 87% (85 runs per setup).</p></div>
<div class="card"><div class="stat">2–3×</div><h3>fewer tokens with CLI</h3><p>Mostly that upfront list — not the work itself.</p></div>
<div class="card dark"><div class="stat">−85%</div><h3>with tool search</h3><p>Load MCP tools only when needed. Accuracy went 49% → 74%.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="banner">The protocol matters less than <em>how the tools are designed.</em></div>

<!--
09:29 — the point: it is not "CLI good, MCP bad". Success is about level; the cost gap is mostly the upfront tool list, and clients now defer it.
Sources: Anthropic "Advanced tool use", 24 Nov 2025 (GitHub MCP ~26K tokens / 35 tools; 5 servers ~55K; tool search −85%, Opus 4 accuracy 49→74%).
Mario Zechner, 15 Aug 2025: same tool as MCP and CLI, 120 runs, 100% vs 100%, $19.45 vs $19.95.
Kun Chen, 21 Mar 2026: 17 GitHub tasks × 5, CLI 86% / $0.054 vs MCP 87% / $0.148 per task. Scalekit, Mar 2026: CLI 1.4–9.4K vs MCP 32–83K tokens.
Claude Code now defers MCP tool loading by default (code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp).

# Measured on Foodora: <span class="y">same steps</span>

Playwright, landing page → checkout: tokens that land in the agent's context. The difference is how it starts.

<TokenBars />

<p class="chart-note">Every modern step costs ~100 tokens: both write the page to a file and return a link. The difference is what loads first. "4× fewer tokens" comes from a Medium post, not Microsoft.</p>

<!--
09:32 — our own measurement, re-runnable: docs/research/measure/run.sh (write-up: docs/research/foodora-measurement.md). Playwright 1.63 built-in MCP and CLI, @playwright/mcp 0.0.82 identical to built-in; 0.0.41 = Oct 2025.
Tokenizer: o200k (OpenAI), within ~10% of Claude. Lower bound: the agent never re-reads the page file; reading it every step adds ~5.6K to each bar.
MCP stopped putting the page tree into every answer in @playwright/mcp 0.0.69 / Playwright 1.59 (Mar–Apr 2026, PR #39768). Only an explicit browser_snapshot puts it inline.
Checkly (Stefan Judis, 30 Jul 2026, one task × 3 runs): CLI 45–48K vs MCP 48–50K — also near parity.
Offer to re-run it live at the CLI exhibit.

# API testing with AI agents: <span class="y">an honest map</span>

Foodora has an API too — on another host. The UI's traffic shows you where: <code>GET https://&lt;another host&gt;/rest/v1/restaurants</code>

<div class="cards c3">
<div class="card"><div class="n">WORKS TODAY</div><h3>Tests from real traffic</h3><p>Show the agent one captured request. Status, shape, filters, errors — written in minutes.</p></div>
<div class="card"><div class="n">WITH CARE</div><h3>Keys and shared data</h3><p>A public key is fine in a test. A secret key never goes in a prompt — and an agent will happily write to a shared database.</p></div>
<div class="card dark"><div class="n">NOT YET</div><h3>Knowing what is right</h3><p>The agent asserts whatever the API returns. Whether that is correct still needs a spec — and a human.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="banner">Best use: the API as a <em>second source of truth</em> for what the UI shows.</div>

<p class="text-lg text-center mt-3">Try it: <code>experiments/2_API</code> — optional, at home or if we have time.</p>

<!--
09:50 — 2 minutes. If running late, skip it and mention the optional experiment in the wrap-up.
The banner is the point: an API test that checks the API against itself proves little. The API
knows each restaurant's delivery fee — test the cart against it. Do not say which bug it finds;
that is the experiment (and Build material).

done: A test file exists, it runs, and you can name one thing the agent got wrong.
stuck: Open the solutions/ folder and read what a good run produces.
---

1. Open the <b>repo root</b> in VS Code and start a Copilot chat in <b>Agent</b>. No MCP servers running — the agent writes the code itself.
2. Paste the prompt from the folder README: a Playwright test that orders a meal and proves it worked, expected results from the spec.
3. Run the test. If it fails, paste the failure back and let the agent fix it — <b>twice</b>, no more.

<p class="mt-5"><span class="hl">Bonus</span> &nbsp;Ask for a negative case: checkout with an empty cart. Did it invent an error message the app never shows?</p>

1. From the <b>repo root</b>: <code>npm run agents</code> → <b>Developer: Reload Window</b> → seed test green → <b>MCP: List Servers</b> → <b>playwright-test</b> → <b>Start Server</b>.
2. New chat, <b>planner</b> + <b>Auto</b> or <b>Claude Haiku 4.5</b>: plan one dish, cash on delivery (prompt in the README). Read its <code>specs/order.md</code> — the artifact a non-coder can review.

done: The skill is on disk and 3+ snapshots are in .playwright-cli/ — not in your context.
stuck: Compare with skills/foodora-order/SKILL.md in the exhibit folder.
---

1. <b>MCP: List Servers</b> → <b>playwright-test</b> → <b>Stop Server</b>. Then, from the <b>repo root</b>: <code>npx playwright init-skills --loop=claude</code>, then open <code>.claude/skills/playwright-cli/SKILL.md</code>. Three frontmatter fields are all the agent holds up front.
2. Drive it by hand: <code>npx playwright cli open …</code> → <code>find</code> → <code>click</code>. <code>open</code>/<code>click</code> answer with a <em>file path</em>; <code>find</code> with a few lines and a ref.
3. Now ask your agent to order the meal. It never had to be told the commands.

<p class="mt-5"><span class="hl">Bonus</span> &nbsp;Write your own <code>SKILL.md</code> for the order flow, copy it to <code>.github/skills/</code> — then break its <code>description</code> and watch the agent stop finding it.</p>

1. Sign in at <code>cmd.wopee.io</code>, <b>NEW PROJECT</b> with the Foodora URL, the <b>+ Checkout</b> chip (or type: *order a meal and verify the confirmation*).
2. Answer its one question — where to explore next — then watch it crawl, write its artifacts and run a scenario on its own.
3. Open the run's report and decide: <b>who says this passed — the agent, the assertions, or you?</b>

<p class="mt-5"><span class="hl">Bonus</span> &nbsp;The <code>wopee</code> MCP server is preset but off — <b>MCP: List Servers → wopee → Start Server</b>.

Tools: Coding Agent x2, Playwright Agents, CLI + Skills x2, Wopee.io.
Seat the two head-to-head pairs apart so they cannot watch each other work — the whole point
